## HU Developer Documentation ansible Research Cloud

This is the developer documentation for catalogus items on research cloud. For end user documentation check: [datascience.hu.nl](https://datascience.hu.nl)

We devided this documentation in a section for playbooks and a section for roles. The playbook can be used stand-alone (run them locally on the target host) or as a SURF ResearchCloud plugin.

The roles serve as reusable building blocks for these playbooks.
